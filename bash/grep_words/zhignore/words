jack
was
bent
double
he
was
down
like
a
sprinter
his
nose
only
a
few
inches
from
the
humid
earth
the
tree
trunks
and
the
creepers
that
festooned
them
lost
themselves
in
a
green
dusk
thirty
feet
above
him
and
all
about
was
the
undergrowth
there
was
only
the
faintest
indication
of
a
trail
here
a
cracked
twig
and
what
might
be
the
impression
of
one
side
of
a
hoof
he
lowered
his
chin
and
stared
at
the
traces
as
though
he
would
force
them
to
speak
to
him
then
dog
like
uncomfortably
on
all
fours
yet
unheeding
his
discomfort
he
stole
forward
five
yards
and
stopped
here
was
loop
of
creeper
with
a
tendril
pendant
from
a
node
the
tendril
was
polished
on
the
underside
pigs
passing
through
the
loop
brushed
it
with
their
bristly
hide
jack
crouched
with
his
face
a
few
inches
away
from
this
clue
then
stared
forward
into
the
semi
darkness
ofthe
undergrowth
his
sandy
hair
considerably
longer
than
it
had
been
when
they
dropped
in
was
lighter
now
and
his
bare
back
was
a
mass
of
dark
freckles
and
peeling
sunburn
a
sharpened
stick
about
five
feet
long
trailed
from
his
right
hand
and
except
for
a
pair
of
tattered
shorts
held
up
by
his
knife
belt
he
was
naked
he
closed
his
eyes
raised
his
head
and
breathed
in
gently
with
flared
nostrils
assessing
the
current
of
warm
air
for
information
the
forest
and
he
were
very
still
at
length
he
let
out
his
breath
in
a
long
sigh
and
opened
his
eyes
they
were
bright
blue
eyes
that
in
this
frustration
seemed
bolting
and
nearly
mad
he
passed
his
tongue
across
dry
lips
and
scanned
the
uncommunicative
forest
then
again
he
stole
forward
and
cast
this
way
and
that
over
the
ground
the
silence
of
the
forest
was
more
oppressive
than
the
heat
and
at
this
hour
of
the
day
there
was
not
even
the
whine
of
insects
only
when
jack
himself
roused
a
gaudy
bird
from
a
primitive
nest
of
sticks
was
the
silence
shattered
and
echoes
set
ringing
by
a
harsh
cry
that
seemed
to
come
out
of
the
abyss
of
ages
jack
himself
shrank
at
this
cry
with
a
hiss
of
indrawn
breath
and
for
a
minute
became
less
a
hunter
than
a
furtive
thing
ape
like
among
the
tangle
of
trees
then
the
trail
the
frustration
claimed
him
again
and
he
searched
the
ground
avidly
by
the
trunk
of
a
vast
tree
that
grew
pale
flowers
on
its
grey
bark
he
checked
closed
his
eyes
and
once
more
drew
in
the
warm
air
and
this
time
his
breath
came
short
there
was
even
a
passing
pallor
in
his
face
and
then
the
surge
of
blood
again
he
passed
like
a
shadow
under
the
darkness
of
the
tree
and
crouched
looking
down
at
the
trodden
ground
at
his
feet
the
droppings
were
warm
they
lay
piled
among
turned
earth
they
were
olive
green
smooth
and
they
steamed
a
little
jack
lifted
his
head
and
stared
at
the
inscrutable
masses
of
creeper
that
lay
across
the
trail
then
he
raised
his
spear
and
sneaked
forward
beyond
the
creeper
the
trail
joined
a
pig
run
that
was
wide
enough
and
trodden
enough
to
be
a
path
the
ground
was
hardened
by
an
accustomed
tread
and
as
jack
rose
to
his
full
height
he
heard
something
moving
on
it
he
swung
back
his
right
arm
and
hurled
the
spear
with
all
his
strength
from
the
pig
run
came
the
quick
hard
patter
of
hoofs
a
castanet
sound
seductive
maddening
the
promise
of
meat
he
rushed
out
of
the
undergrowth
and
snatched
up
his
spear
the
pattering
of
pig
s
trotters
died
away
in
the
distance
jack
stood
there
streaming
with
sweat
streaked
with
brown
earth
stained
by
all
the
vicissitudes
of
a
day
s
hunting
swearing
he
turned
off
the
trail
and
pushed
his
way
through
until
the
forest
opened
a
little
and
instead
of
bald
trunks
supporting
a
dark
roof
there
were
light
grey
trunks
and
crowns
of
feathery
palm
beyond
these
was
the
glitter
of
the
sea
and
he
could
hear
voices
ralph
was
standing
by
a
contraption
of
palm
trunks
and
leaves
a
rude
shelter
that
faced
the
lagoon
and
seemed
very
near
to
falling
down
he
did
not
notice
when
jack
spoke
got
any
water
ralph
looked
up
frowning
from
the
complication
of
leaves
he
did
not
notice
jack
even
when
he
saw
him
i
said
have
you
got
any
water
i
m
thirsty
ralph
withdrew
his
attention
from
the
shelter
and
realized
jack
with
a
start
oh
hullo
water
there
by
the
tree
ought
to
be
some
left
jack
took
up
a
coconut
shell
that
brimmed
with
fresh
water
from
among
a
group
that
was
arranged
in
the
shade
and
drank
the
water
splashed
over
his
chin
and
neck
and
chest
he
breathed
noisily
when
he
had
finished
needed
that
simon
spoke
from
inside
the
shelter
up
a
bit
ralph
turned
to
the
shelter
and
lifted
a
branch
with
a
whole
tiling
of
leaves
the
leaves
came
apart
and
fluttered
down
simon
s
contrite
face
appeared
in
the
hole
sorry
ralph
surveyed
the
wreck
with
distaste
never
get
it
done
he
flung
himself
down
at
jack
s
feet
simon
remained
looking
out
of
the
hole
in
the
shelter
once
down
ralph
explained
been
working
for
days
now
and
look
two
shelters
were
in
position
but
shaky
this
one
was
a
ruin
and
they
keep
running
off
you
remember
the
meeting
how
everyone
was
going
to
work
hard
until
the
shelters
were
finished
except
me
and
my
hunters
except
the
hunters
well
the
littluns
are
he
gesticulated
sought
for
a
word
they
re
hopeless
the
older
ones
aren
t
much
better
d
you
see
all
day
i
ve
been
working
with
simon
no
one
else
they
re
off
bathing
or
eating
or
playing
simon
poked
his
head
out
carefully
you
re
chief
you
tell
em
off
ralph
lay
flat
and
looked
up
at
the
palm
trees
and
the
sky
meetings
don
t
we
love
meetings
every
day
twice
a
day
we
talk
he
got
on
one
elbow
i
bet
if
i
blew
the
conch
this
minute
they
d
come
running
then
we
d
be
you
know
very
solemn
and
someone
would
say
we
ought
to
build
a
jet
or
a
submarine
or
a
TV
set
when
the
meeting
was
over
they
d
work
for
five
minutes
then
wander
off
or
go
hunting
jack
flushed
we
want
meat
well
we
haven
t
got
any
yet
and
we
want
shelters
besides
the
rest
of
your
hunters
came
back
hours
ago
they
ve
been
swimming
i
went
on
said
jack
i
let
them
go
i
had
to
go
on
i
he
tried
to
convey
the
compulsion
to
track
down
and
kill
that
was
swallowing
him
up
i
went
on
i
thought
by
myself
the
madness
came
into
his
eyes
again
i
thought
i
might
kill
but
you
didn
t
i
thought
i
might
some
hidden
passion
vibrated
in
ralph
s
voice
but
you
haven
t
yet
his
invitation
might
have
passed
as
casual
were
it
not
for
the
undertone
you
wouldn
t
care
to
help
with
the
shelters
i
suppose
we
want
meat
and
we
don
t
get
it
now
the
antagonism
was
audible
but
i
shall
next
time
i
ve
got
to
get
a
barb
on
this
spear
we
wounded
a
pig
and
the
spear
fell
out
if
we
could
only
make
barbs
we
need
shelters
suddenly
jack
shouted
in
rage
are
you
accusing
all
i
m
saying
is
we
ve
worked
dashed
hard
that
s
all
they
were
both
red
in
the
face
and
found
looking
at
each
other
difficult
ralph
rolled
on
his
stomach
and
began
to
play
with
the
grass
if
it
rains
like
when
we
dropped
in
we
ll
need
shelters
all
right
and
then
another
thing
we
need
shelters
because
of
the
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
they
both
pushed
their
anger
away
then
he
went
on
with
the
safe
changed
subject
you
ve
noticed
haven
t
you
jack
put
down
his
spear
and
squatted
noticed
what
well
they
re
frightened
he
rolled
over
and
peered
into
jack
s
fierce
dirty
face
i
mean
the
way
things
are
they
dream
you
can
hear
em
have
you
been
awake
at
night
jack
shook
his
head
they
talk
and
scream
the
littluns
even
some
of
the
others
as
if
as
if
it
wasn
t
a
good
island
astonished
at
the
interruption
they
looked
up
at
simon
s
serious
face
as
if
said
simon
the
beastie
the
beastie
or
the
snake
thing
was
real
remember
the
two
older
boys
flinched
when
they
heard
the
shameful
syllable
snakes
were
not
mentioned
now
were
not
mentionable
as
if
this
wasn
t
a
good
island
said
ralph
slowly
yes
that
s
right
jack
sat
up
and
stretched
out
his
legs
they
re
batty
crackers
remember
when
we
went
exploring
they
grinned
at
each
other
remembering
the
glamour
of
the
first
day
ralph
went
on
so
we
need
shelters
as
a
sort
of
home
that
s
right
jack
drew
up
his
legs
clasped
his
knees
and
frowned
in
an
effort
to
attain
clarity
all
the
same
in
the
forest
i
mean
when
you
re
hunting
not
when
you
re
getting
fruit
of
course
but
when
you
re
on
your
own
he
paused
for
a
moment
not
sure
if
ralph
would
take
him
seriously
go
on
if
you
re
hunting
sometimes
you
catch
yourself
feeling
as
if
he
flushed
suddenly
there
s
nothing
in
it
of
course
just
a
feeling
but
you
can
feel
as
if
you
re
not
hunting
but
being
hunted
as
if
something
s
behind
you
all
the
time
in
the
jungle
they
were
silent
again
simon
intent
ralph
incredulous
and
faintly
indignant
he
sat
up
rubbing
one
shoulder
with
a
dirty
hand
well
i
don
t
know
jack
leapt
to
his
feet
and
spoke
very
quickly
that
s
how
you
can
feel
in
the
forest
of
course
there
s
nothing
in
it
only
only
he
took
a
few
rapid
steps
toward
the
beach
then
came
back
only
i
know
how
they
feel
see
that
s
all
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
get
ourselves
rescued
jack
had
to
think
for
a
moment
before
he
could
remember
what
rescue
was
rescue
yes
of
course
all
the
same
i
d
like
to
catch
a
pig
first
he
snatched
up
his
spear
and
dashed
it
into
the
ground
the
opaque
mad
look
came
into
his
eyes
again
ralph
looked
at
him
critically
through
his
tangle
of
fair
hair
so
long
as
your
hunters
remember
the
fire
you
and
your
fire
the
two
boys
trotted
down
the
beach
and
turning
at
the
water
s
edge
looked
back
at
the
pink
mountain
the
trickle
of
smoke
sketched
a
chalky
line
up
the
solid
blue
of
the
sky
wavered
high
up
and
faded
ralph
frowned
i
wonder
how
far
off
you
could
see
that
miles
we
don
t
make
enough
smoke
the
bottom
part
of
the
trickle
as
though
conscious
of
their
gaze
thickened
to
a
creamy
blur
which
crept
up
the
feeble
column
they
ve
put
on
green
branches
muttered
ralph
i
wonder
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
swung
round
to
search
the
horizon
got
it
jack
shouted
so
loudly
that
ralph
jumped
what
where
is
it
a
ship
but
jack
was
pointing
to
the
high
declivities
that
led
down
from
the
mountain
to
the
flatter
part
of
the
island
of
course
they
ll
lie
up
there
they
must
when
the
sun
s
too
hot
ralph
gazed
bewildered
at
his
rapt
face
they
get
up
high
high
up
and
in
the
shade
resting
during
the
heat
like
cows
at
home
i
thought
you
saw
a
ship
we
could
steal
up
on
one
paint
our
faces
so
they
wouldn
t
see
perhaps
surround
them
and
then
indignation
took
away
ralph
s
control
i
was
talking
about
smoke
don
t
you
want
to
be
rescued
all
you
can
talk
about
is
pig
pig
pig
but
we
want
meat
and
i
work
all
day
with
nothing
but
simon
and
you
come
back
and
don
t
even
notice
the
huts
i
was
working
too
but
you
like
it
shouted
ralph
you
want
to
hunt
while
i
they
faced
each
other
on
the
bright
beach
astonished
at
the
rub
of
feeling
ralph
looked
away
first
pretending
interest
in
a
group
of
littluns
on
the
sand
from
beyond
the
platform
came
the
shouting
of
the
hunters
in
the
swimming
pool
on
the
end
of
the
platform
piggy
was
lying
flat
looking
down
into
the
brilliant
water
people
don
t
help
much
he
wanted
to
explain
how
people
were
never
quite
what
you
thought
they
were
simon
he
helps
he
pointed
at
the
shelters
all
the
rest
rushed
off
he
s
done
as
much
as
i
have
only
simon
s
always
about
ralph
stared
back
to
the
shelters
with
jack
by
his
side
do
a
bit
for
you
muttered
jack
before
i
have
a
bathe
don
t
bother
but
when
they
reached
the
shelters
simon
was
not
to
be
seen
ralph
put
his
head
in
the
hole
withdrew
it
and
turned
to
jack
he
s
buzzed
off
got
fed
up
said
jack
and
gone
for
a
bathe
ralph
frowned
he
s
queer
he
s
funny
jack
nodded
as
much
for
the
sake
of
agreeing
as
anything
and
by
tacit
consent
they
left
the
shelter
and
went
toward
the
bathing
pool
and
then
said
jack
when
i
ve
had
a
bathe
and
something
to
eat
i
ll
just
trek
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
and
see
if
i
can
see
any
traces
coming
but
the
sun
s
nearly
set
i
might
have
time
they
walked
along
two
continents
of
experience
and
feeling
unable
to
communicate
if
i
could
only
get
a
pig
i
ll
come
back
and
go
on
with
the
shelter
they
looked
at
each
other
baffled
in
love
and
hate
all
the
warm
salt
water
of
the
bathing
pool
and
the
shouting
and
splashing
and
laughing
were
only
just
sufficient
to
bring
them
together
again
simon
was
not
in
the
bathing
pool
as
they
had
expected
when
the
other
two
had
trotted
down
the
beach
to
look
back
at
the
mountain
he
had
followed
them
for
a
few
yards
and
then
stopped
he
had
stood
frowing
down
at
a
pile
of
sand
on
the
beach
where
somebody
had
been
trying
to
build
a
little
house
or
hut
then
he
turned
his
back
on
this
and
walked
into
the
forest
with
an
air
of
purpose
he
was
a
small
skinny
boy
his
chin
pointed
and
his
eyes
so
bright
they
had
deceived
ralph
into
thinking
him
delightfully
gay
and
wicked
the
coarse
mop
of
black
hair
was
long
and
swung
down
almost
concealing
a
low
broad
forehead
he
wore
the
remains
of
shorts
and
his
feet
were
bare
like
jack
s
always
darkish
in
color
simon
was
burned
by
the
sun
to
a
deep
tan
that
glistened
with
sweat
he
picked
his
way
up
the
scar
passed
the
great
rock
where
ralph
had
climbed
on
the
first
morning
then
turned
off
to
his
right
among
the
trees
he
walked
with
an
accustomed
tread
through
the
acres
of
fruit
trees
where
the
least
energetic
could
find
an
easy
if
unsatisfying
meal
flower
and
fruit
grew
together
on
the
same
tree
and
everywhere
was
the
scent
of
ripeness
and
the
booming
of
a
million
bees
at
pasture
here
the
littluns
who
had
run
after
him
caught
up
with
him
they
talked
cried
out
unintelligibly
lugged
him
toward
the
trees
then
amid
the
roar
of
bees
in
the
afternoon
sunlight
simon
found
for
them
the
fruit
they
could
not
reach
pulled
off
the
choicest
from
up
in
the
foliage
passed
them
back
down
to
the
endless
outstretched
hands
when
he
had
satisfied
them
he
paused
and
looked
round
the
littluns
watched
him
inscrutably
over
double
handfuls
of
ripe
fruit
simon
turned
away
from
them
and
went
where
the
just
perceptible
path
led
him
soon
high
jungle
closed
in
tall
trunks
bore
unexpected
pale
flowers
all
the
way
up
to
the
dark
canopy
where
life
went
on
clamorously
the
air
here
was
dark
too
and
the
creepers
dropped
their
ropes
like
the
rigging
of
foundered
ships
his
feet
left
prints
in
the
soft
soil
and
the
creepers
shivered
throughout
their
lengths
when
he
bumped
them
he
came
at
last
to
a
place
where
more
sunshine
fell
since
they
had
not
so
far
to
go
for
light
the
creepers
had
woven
a
great
mat
that
hung
at
the
side
of
an
open
space
in
the
jungle
for
here
a
patch
of
rock
came
close
to
the
surface
and
would
not
allow
more
than
little
plants
and
ferns
to
grow
the
whole
space
was
walled
with
dark
aromatic
bushes
and
was
a
bowl
of
heat
and
light
a
great
tree
fallen
across
one
corner
leaned
against
the
trees
that
still
stood
and
a
rapid
climber
flaunted
red
and
yellow
sprays
right
to
the
top
simon
paused
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
as
jack
had
done
at
the
close
ways
behind
him
and
glanced
swiftly
round
to
confirm
that
he
was
utterly
alone
for
a
moment
his
movements
were
almost
furtive
then
he
bent
down
and
wormed
his
way
into
the
center
of
the
mat
the
creepers
and
the
bushes
were
so
close
that
he
left
his
sweat
on
them
and
they
pulled
together
behind
him
when
he
was
secure
in
the
middle
he
was
in
a
little
cabin
screened
off
from
the
open
space
by
a
few
leaves
he
squatted
down
parted
the
leaves
and
looked
out
into
the
clearing
nothing
moved
but
a
pair
of
gaudy
butterflies
that
danced
round
each
other
in
the
hot
air
holding
his
breath
he
cocked
a
critical
ear
at
the
sounds
of
the
island
evening
was
advancing
toward
the
island
the
sounds
of
the
bright
fantastic
birds
the
bee
sounds
even
the
crying
of
the
gulls
that
were
returning
to
their
roosts
among
the
square
rocks
were
fainter
the
deep
sea
breaking
miles
away
on
the
reef
made
an
undertone
less
perceptible
than
the
susurration
of
the
blood
simon
dropped
the
screen
of
leaves
back
into
place
the
slope
of
the
bars
of
honey
colored
sunlight
decreased
they
slid
up
the
bushes
passed
over
the
green
candle
like
buds
moved
up
toward
the
canopy
and
darkness
thickened
under
the
trees
with
the
fading
of
the
light
the
riotous
colors
died
and
the
heat
and
urgency
cooled
away
the
candlebuds
stirred
their
green
sepals
drew
back
a
little
and
the
white
tips
of
the
flowers
rose
delicately
to
meet
the
open
air
now
the
sunlight
had
lifted
clear
of
the
open
space
and
withdrawn
from
the
sky
darkness
poured
out
submerging
the
ways
between
the
trees
till
they
were
dim
and
strange
as
the
bottom
of
the
sea
the
candle
buds
opened
their
wide
white
flowers
glimmering
under
the
light
that
pricked
down
from
the
first
stars
their
scent
spilled
out
into
the
air
and
took
possession
of
the
